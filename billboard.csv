Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Riding on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche

You ain't been up off that porch, now
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Riding on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull riding and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'

I'm gonna ride til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride til I can't no more
Hat down, cross town, living like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Riding down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride til I can't no more
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road

No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down
Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now
But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Well, it takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
That's gripping down on a cold one
'Cause longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars, and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart

Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus Yeah
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set

Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette

We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart cause I ain't gonna break it

Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay

You good, T-Minus?
Niggas been counting me out
I'm counting my bullets, I'm loading my clips
I'm writing down names, I'm making a list
I'm checking it twice and I'm getting em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't popping no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was praying I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be cause my shit ain't selling the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thanking you now
Was watching you when you was paving the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice
Niggas been counting me out
I'm counting my bullets, I'm loading my clips
I'm writing down names, I'm making a list
I'm checking it twice and I'm getting em hit

The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I just poured something in my cup
I've been wanting something I can feel
Promise I am never letting up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got em stuck
I'ma give em something they can feel
If it ain't bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga
I just poured something in my cup
I've been wanting something I can feel
Promise I am never letting up

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

Beer don't keep
Love's not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink
Daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishing well
Money ain't rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it
Girls like to laugh
Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat
Everybody's gotta past
And love's worth living for
When you dance, hold her close
'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it
When you can't take it slow
'Cause time sure won't
What really makes you a man
Is being true to her til your glass runs out of sand

You ain't feeling them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waiting for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're getting ready
I'm just sitting there watching TV
Here you come looking like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe
I talked you into slipping down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're looking like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it
Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watching people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar
I talked you into slipping down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind

I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it
Yeah, it's a little cold outside
Music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leaving now

Jumping on a trampoline
Flipping in the air
I never land just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to falling leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved So loved
I've been having dreams
Splashing in a summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushing weight of paradise
Solid block of gold
Lying in the cold
I feel right at home
Wait if I'm on fire

I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes Those ocean eyes
I'm scared I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high

And traffic stopped for them Cadillac lights

And everybody raised em high singin'

Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testing me gon' have my niggas testing machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buying up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxing while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot cause they told on me
I'm bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buying the building of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm banking two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Ripping markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgiving mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are living through
Keeping my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailing all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me riding over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doing math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playing in a sport where we were getting rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah

Uh, me and you on an island
With the ocean color stuck in your iris
We comfortable in silence
But I prefer it when we wilding
Sundress, nothing underneath as we undress Woo!

I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down
Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now
But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Well, it takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
That's gripping down on a cold one
'Cause longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars, and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, no

What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit

Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist

Back when the rap game was praying I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame

Daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishing well
Money ain't rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it
Girls like to laugh
Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for

Everybody's gotta past
And love's worth living for
When you dance, hold her close
'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand

Got a little boot stomp in my walk

Got some Tennessee in my whiskey

Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie

Jumping on a trampoline
Flipping in the air
I never land just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to falling leaves

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying

Splashing in a summer stream

I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushing weight of paradise

Lying in the cold

When you want to lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain

And that preacher talked about sacrifice
And traffic stopped for them Cadillac lights

And everybody raised em high singin'

I'm counting my bullets, I'm loading my clips
I'm writing down names, I'm making a list
I'm checking it twice and I'm getting em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit

But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I ain't popping no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was praying I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be cause my shit ain't selling the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thanking you now
Was watching you when you was paving the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have just to know how it feels

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

I fall into your arms

Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that ya'll come back sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear
It ain't nothing but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothing what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothing but a rearview town
I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new
It ain't nothing but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothing what it used to be

You ain't feeling them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waiting for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're getting ready
I'm just sitting there watching TV
Here you come looking like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe
I talked you into slipping down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're looking like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it
Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watching people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar
I talked you into slipping down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind

I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it
Yeah, it's a little cold outside
Music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leaving now

So baby, put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‚ÄòCause I'm on my way to you
Yeah, every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile
All the boats I've missed
All the hell I've caused
All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I thank God for that
I guess he always knew
I was on my way to you
On my way to you
On my way to you

I've been having dreams
Jumping on a trampoline
Flipping in the air
I never land just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to falling leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved So loved
I've been having dreams
Splashing in a summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushing weight of paradise
Solid block of gold
Lying in the cold
I feel right at home
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
Wait if I'm on fire

Little pickup truck on my highway
Got a little boot stomp in my walk
Little neon lighting my Friday
Got some Tennessee in my whiskey
Raise a cup up if you with me

Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie

If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio
'Cause if you know me, I was raised on country
It's the only reason that I survived
Every breakup and every party
It's the soundtrack to my life

Blowing up my phone cause she just see me with my new bae

Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face

Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make Wish I never had to make
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate I just seen him graduate
Got that 40 on my side and I'm just rolling patty cakes I'm just rolling past jakes
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talking masturbate
I was in and outta state State cause I had a bag to make Bag to make

You good, T-Minus?
Niggas been counting me out
I'm counting my bullets, I'm loading my clips
I'm writing down names, I'm making a list
I'm checking it twice and I'm getting em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't popping no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was praying I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be cause my shit ain't selling the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thanking you now
Was watching you when you was paving the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I've been wanting something I can feel
Promise I am never letting up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got em stuck
I'ma give em something they can feel

Pistol in your hand don't make you real

Reminded me of young niggas from Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest

We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail

Today, I'm thinking about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinking you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably something that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now Wow
Calling security, keeping my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no

I don't know, it's alright
I've been dealing with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night
""I'm sorry, that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts telling me I'm lost getting too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Something funny's going on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinking maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out
I've been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate? I've been learning
Grabbing my keepsakes, leaving my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Looking at the view, like this concerns me
Picking up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Looking for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talking down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for cracking jokes
I'm looking for the map to hope, you seen it?
Been making a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm saying, and‚Äî
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinking is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm making movies or music videos Videos, videos
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got something that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hoping it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm making is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great‚Äînot because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith Woo
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothing to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smiling big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me Tone that down, but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist

Cuatro abrazos y un cafe

Y al mirarte recorde
Que ya todo lo encontre
Tu mano en mi mano
De todo escapamos
Juntos ver el sol caer
Let them enjoy the paradise
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tu le coqueteas, tu eres busca bullas y me gusta
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento
Ya, ya, ya, ¬°Farru!
Y aprovecha que el sol ta caliente y vamo' a disfrutar el ambiente
Vamono' a meternos pa'l agua pa' que veas que rico se siente
Y vamono' en tropical, por to'a la costa a chinchorrear
De chinchorro a chinchorro paramo' a darno' una Medalla
Bien fria, pa' bajar la sequia
Un poco de Bob Marley y unos trago' e sangria
Pa' que te sueltes, poco a poquito
Porque pa' vacilar no hay que salir de Puerto Rico
Y dale lento, date un shot de Coquito
Y como dice Fonsi: Vamo' a darle despacito Ya, ya, ya

Metele hasta abajo, esta duro ese movimiento
El unico testigo que tenemos aqui e' el viento
Y dale, metele cintura, matame con tu hermosura
Mira como me frontea porque sabe que esta dura

Que nada hace falta

And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay
Uh, I don't know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level's no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain't even bedtime
And don't you dare bring up your ex cause he a dead guy
I wonder
Why, oh why? Oh why?
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?

I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl

That ain't the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga Work
With your mind and your heart and your soul Let's go
For your goals, in control, you let it go Work
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby
Why, oh why? Oh why?
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal
You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day he'll grow up and be a man
And lately you been pouring out your heart on the Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile

With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?

'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts

Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fucking listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's coming to get the cannabis
I'm looking for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Battering everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standing stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringing the bandana back, and the fucking headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinking of bringing the fucking fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fucking millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fucking terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fucking air duct
I'm about to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attacking it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm planning to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're looking and staring at mannequins
And I'm going to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against

While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-

I'm in a cabana chanting all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lacking the stamina
You're lacking the stamina while you're divorcing Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards

One thing my dad told me was, Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time they're insecure""
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? For real? For real?
Is your love really true?

When you come around
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you

Gotta cross my T's and dot my I's or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail

How you die thirty something after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna shedding tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear

Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect

Flipping in the air
I never land just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to falling leaves

Wait if I'm on fire

When I dream of dying

Splashing in a summer stream

My body turns to ice
Crushing weight of paradise

Lying in the cold

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

You good, T-Minus?
Niggas been counting me out
I'm counting my bullets, I'm loading my clips
I'm writing down names, I'm making a list
I'm checking it twice and I'm getting em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't popping no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was praying I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be cause my shit ain't selling the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thanking you now
Was watching you when you was paving the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice
Niggas been counting me out
I'm counting my bullets, I'm loading my clips
I'm writing down names, I'm making a list
I'm checking it twice and I'm getting em hit

The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I just poured something in my cup
I've been wanting something I can feel
Promise I am never letting up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got em stuck
I'ma give em something they can feel
If it ain't bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga
I just poured something in my cup
I've been wanting something I can feel
Promise I am never letting up

I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe

'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent

Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancee
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyonce
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you tripping anyway, like when I fuck em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're riding in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time
We started off as close friends Close friends
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend My girlfriend
We used to tell each other everything Everything
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool So cool
Lately baby been acting so rude Been so rude
I don't know what somebody told you What they told you

Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly

The way I'm drinking you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably something that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now Wow
Calling security, keeping my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
Step on the glass, staple your tongue Ahh
Bury a friend, try to wake up Ah-ahh

You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day he'll grow up and be a man
And lately you been pouring out your heart on the Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time

It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

I'll take a left at the bank
And I'll head straight through town

I woke up in a hearse
You said, You loved me first First
One thing my dad told me was, Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time they're insecure""
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? For real? For real?
Is your love really true?

You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around

When you come around
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer

I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home

It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thanking you now
Was watching you when you was paving the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice
Niggas been counting me out
I'm counting my bullets, I'm loading my clips
I'm writing down names, I'm making a list
I'm checking it twice and I'm getting em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I just poured something in my cup
I've been wanting something I can feel
Promise I am never letting up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got em stuck
I'ma give em something they can feel
If it ain't bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga
I just poured something in my cup
I've been wanting something I can feel
Promise I am never letting up
Money in your palm don't make you real

And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Hotels are made for two night stays, checking in and out
Meeting strangers in the lobby
Waking up and leaving town the next day
But love ain't
And whiskey's poured for when you're bored
And alone on Friday night
When you want to lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain
But love ain't
Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't
Sad movies are for crying on the couch there in the dark
That sad song it was written just to try and get your heart to break
But love ain't

That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothing to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talking to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, cause I ain't‚Äì

I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Somebody to have just to know how it feels

And you're not here to get me through it all

I fall into your arms

What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?

Uh
Yeah, yeah
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough Yeah
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus Yeah
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight

Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing
We can do anything if we put our minds to it

Give me your heart cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today

It was red taillights when she left town

I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rapping with me
Fuck it cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it a lot, I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flecting on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not

And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind

I was swinging from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'

You good, T-Minus?
Niggas been counting me out
I'm counting my bullets, I'm loading my clips
I'm writing down names, I'm making a list
I'm checking it twice and I'm getting em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't popping no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was praying I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be cause my shit ain't selling the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thanking you now
Was watching you when you was paving the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

I just poured something in my cup
I've been wanting something I can feel
Promise I am never letting up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got em stuck
I'ma give em something they can feel
If it ain't bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate

And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

Vamono' a meternos pa'l agua pa' que veas que rico se siente
Y vamono' en tropical, por to'a la costa a chinchorrear
De chinchorro a chinchorro paramo' a darno' una Medalla
Bien fria, pa' bajar la sequia
Un poco de Bob Marley y unos trago' e sangria
Pa' que te sueltes, poco a poquito

You good, T-Minus?
Niggas been counting me out
I'm counting my bullets, I'm loading my clips
I'm writing down names, I'm making a list
I'm checking it twice and I'm getting em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't popping no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was praying I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be cause my shit ain't selling the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thanking you now
Was watching you when you was paving the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Promise I am never letting up

Foot is on they neck, I got em stuck
I'ma give em something they can feel

Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest

We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal

We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well

If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been

Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth

Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

Gotta cross my T's and dot my I's or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale

Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closing Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty something after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna shedding tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear

See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck

¬°Farru!
Cuatro abrazos y un cafe
Apenas me desperte
Y al mirarte recorde
Que ya todo lo encontre
Tu mano en mi mano
De todo escapamos
Juntos ver el sol caer
Let them enjoy the paradise
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tu le coqueteas, tu eres busca bullas y me gusta
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento
Ya, ya, ya, ¬°Farru!
Y aprovecha que el sol ta caliente y vamo' a disfrutar el ambiente
Vamono' a meternos pa'l agua pa' que veas que rico se siente
Y vamono' en tropical, por to'a la costa a chinchorrear
De chinchorro a chinchorro paramo' a darno' una Medalla
Bien fria, pa' bajar la sequia
Un poco de Bob Marley y unos trago' e sangria
Pa' que te sueltes, poco a poquito
Porque pa' vacilar no hay que salir de Puerto Rico
Y dale lento, date un shot de Coquito
Y como dice Fonsi: Vamo' a darle despacito Ya, ya, ya
Pa' que te suelte', poco a poquito
Porque pa' vacilar no hay que salir de Puerto Rico Laramercy gang

Y darle lento, metele violento
Te puse reggaeton pa' que me apague' ese cuerpo
Metele hasta abajo, esta duro ese movimiento
El unico testigo que tenemos aqui e' el viento
Y dale, metele cintura, matame con tu hermosura
Mira como me frontea porque sabe que esta dura
Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si estamos juntitos andando
Calma, mi vida, con calma

You good, T-Minus?
Niggas been counting me out
I'm counting my bullets, I'm loading my clips
I'm writing down names, I'm making a list
I'm checking it twice and I'm getting em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't popping no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was praying I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be cause my shit ain't selling the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thanking you now
Was watching you when you was paving the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

I just poured something in my cup
I've been wanting something I can feel
Promise I am never letting up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got em stuck
I'ma give em something they can feel
If it ain't bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

Yeah, yeah
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough Yeah
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus Yeah
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love
He used to meet me on the Eastside

And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight

Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing
We can do anything if we put our minds to it

His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

The way I'm drinking you down

Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably something that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now Wow
Calling security, keeping my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no

Welcome To The Paradise
¬°Farru!
Cuatro abrazos y un cafe
Apenas me desperte
Y al mirarte recorde
Que ya todo lo encontre
Tu mano en mi mano
De todo escapamos
Juntos ver el sol caer
Let them enjoy the paradise
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tu le coqueteas, tu eres busca bullas y me gusta
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento
Ya, ya, ya, ¬°Farru!
Y aprovecha que el sol ta caliente y vamo' a disfrutar el ambiente
Vamono' a meternos pa'l agua pa' que veas que rico se siente
Y vamono' en tropical, por to'a la costa a chinchorrear
De chinchorro a chinchorro paramo' a darno' una Medalla
Bien fria, pa' bajar la sequia
Un poco de Bob Marley y unos trago' e sangria
Pa' que te sueltes, poco a poquito
Porque pa' vacilar no hay que salir de Puerto Rico
Y dale lento, date un shot de Coquito
Y como dice Fonsi: Vamo' a darle despacito Ya, ya, ya
Pa' que te suelte', poco a poquito
Porque pa' vacilar no hay que salir de Puerto Rico Laramercy gang
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma

Tu le coqueteas, baby, tu estas dura y me gusta
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento

Farru, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Y darle lento, metele violento
Te puse reggaeton pa' que me apague' ese cuerpo
Metele hasta abajo, esta duro ese movimiento
El unico testigo que tenemos aqui e' el viento
Y dale, metele cintura, matame con tu hermosura
Mira como me frontea porque sabe que esta dura
Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si estamos juntitos andando
Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si andamos juntitos bailando
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
